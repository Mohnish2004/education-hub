# Computational Structural Biology

> Pre-user, User, Design, Docking, Modeling

During the course we will explore concepts and algorithms that enable computational modeling of biological molecules, in both theory and practice. In this framework, We will learn to use Rosetta, one of the leading protein modeling suites. These methods are applied in predicting protein structure, docking multiple proteins into complexes, designing new proteins for medical or industrial purposes, and other cutting-edge scientific research.
