# Pre-College Rosetta Internship Opportunity Workflow and Resource Hub

> Pre-user, Design, Foldit, Protein Complexes, PyRosetta

This module workflow will give you the opportunity to investigate mutations in a protein system that you think might optimize, disrupt, or affect the system in some capacity! In the guides and protocols linked, you'll see that we are working with a SARS-CoV2 miniprotein binder. However, these resources can easily be adapted to work with other protein systems
