Foldit lab reports are monthly YouTube installments of updates from the Foldit design review and testing team at the Institute for Protein Design. In these short videos (5-15 minutes), Dr. Brian Koepnick will take you on a tour of top player designs and any relevant wet-lab testing results or recent findings that inform Foldit efforts.
