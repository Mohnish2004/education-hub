        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">RosettaCommons is the central hub for hundreds of developers and scientists from over 100 universities and laboratories to contribute and share the Rosetta source code. It has enabled notable scientific advances in computational biology, including but not limited to de novo protein design, enzyme design, ligand docking, and structure prediction of biological macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold dark:text-white">Rosetta Commons</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">An Innovative Model for Collaboration. RosettaCommons members develop software improvements to solve their unique queries. We continually publish these new codesets to help others with their research.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold dark:text-white">Rosetta Software</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">The Rosetta software suite includes algorithms for computational modeling and analysis of protein structures.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold dark:text-white">Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Rosetta Commons</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">The Rosetta Commons exists to enable shared developments and discoveries. We believe in the power of community to accelerate science. We strive to make our community inclusive and equitable for people of all backgrounds, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, age, belief system, and socioeconomic background.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">The Commons urges the individual research groups in our community to make every effort to proactively and swiftly eliminate discriminatory policies and procedures in hiring and recruitment and to make efforts to increase the number of individuals from historically underrepresented groups in the Rosetta community. It should be a high priority for everyone in the Commons and the individual research groups to provide a welcoming workplace environment that is physically accessible to all and free of harassment and bias, both implicit and explicit.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">These hiring and workplace practices are undertaken first and foremost because they are required to maintain an ethical and just community of scientists. Further, a diverse community increases the likelihood of novel approaches and applications of Rosetta science and enriches the experience of all members. Lastly, measures to increase the diversity and fairness of our research community will ensure that the next generation of scientists is drawn from all groups of people, resulting in a robust workforce on which the future of science and our society depend.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">This statement was developed collaboratively with leadership from the Rosetta Commons Diversity and Inclusion Committee. It was unanimously adopted by the Rosetta Commons Executive Board in September 2018.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold dark:text-white">Rosetta Commons - Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">A Cyberlinked Program in Computational Biomolecular Structure & Design. Interns in this geographically-distributed REU program have the opportunity to participate in research using the Rosetta Commons software. The Rosetta Commons software suite includes algorithms for computational modeling and analysis of protein structures. It has enabled notable scientific advances in computational biology, including de novo protein design, enzyme design, ligand docking, and structure prediction of biological macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.</p>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">The Program</h4>
      <ul class="list-disc list-outside space-y-5 ps-5 text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
        <li class="ps-2">One week of Rosetta Code School (June 5 through June 9) where you will learn the inner details of the RosettaPython code and community coding environment, so you are fully prepared for the summer!</li>
        <li class="ps-2">8 weeks of hands-on research in a molecular modeling and design laboratory, developing new algorithms and discovering new science.</li>
        <li class="ps-2">The summer will finish with a trip to the Rosetta Conference in the gorgeous Cascade Mountains of Washington State, where you will present your research in a poster and connect with Rosetta developers from around the world. The conference will be held from August 5 through August 8.</li>
        <li class="ps-2">This program is supported by NSF (Award 2244288). Interns will receive housing, paid travel expenses, and a $6,000 stipend.</li>
        <li class="ps-2">Program dates are June 3, 2024 â€“ August 9, 2024.</li>
